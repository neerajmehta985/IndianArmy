                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>The Indian Army traces its origins to 1895, when it was established under the British Raj as part of the British Indian Army. Following India's independence on August 15, 1947, it transitioned into the national army of the Dominion of India, and subsequently the Republic of India in 1950. Over the decades, the Indian Army has fought in four major wars with Pakistan (1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999), the Sino-Indian War of 1962, and numerous counter-insurgency operations. It has also played a pivotal role in global peacekeeping, contributing to United Nations missions in regions like Congo, Sudan, and the Middle East. The Army's legacy is marked by iconic victories, such as the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971 and Operation Vijay in Kargil, showcasing its strategic prowess and unwavering commitment to the nation.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>The Indian Army's primary mission is to safeguard India's national security, territorial integrity, and unity. It defends the nation against external aggression and internal threats, while maintaining peace and stability within its borders. Beyond combat, the Army engages in humanitarian efforts, disaster relief operations, and nation-building activities, such as constructing infrastructure in remote areas and providing medical aid during crises. Guided by the motto "Service Before Self," the Indian Army strives to uphold the values of honor, discipline, and patriotism in all its endeavors.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Organization</h2>
                    <p>The Indian Army is a highly structured force, organized into seven operational commands: Northern, Eastern, Western, Central, Southern, South Western, and Army Training Command (ARTRAC). Each command is led by a Lieutenant General and oversees specific geographic regions and operational responsibilities. With over 1.4 million active personnel and 2.1 million reserve personnel, it is the world's second-largest standing army. The Army comprises 15 corps, numerous divisions, and specialized units, including infantry, artillery, armored, and engineering regiments. It also maintains elite forces like the Parachute Regiment and the Gorkha Rifles, known for their exceptional combat capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Training and Development</h2>
                    <p>The Indian Army places immense emphasis on training to prepare its personnel for diverse challenges. Institutions like the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun, National Defence Academy (NDA) in Khadakwasla, and Officers Training Academy (OTA) in Chennai produce world-class officers. Soldiers undergo rigorous training at regimental centers, focusing on physical fitness, combat skills, and leadership. The Army also conducts joint exercises with foreign militaries, such as Exercise Yudh Abhyas with the United States and Exercise Shakti with France, to enhance interoperability and adopt global best practices.</p>
